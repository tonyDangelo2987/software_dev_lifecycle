# Software Development Lifecycle
## Sprint Retrospective and Review

User needs are actual cases/scenarios of what the user would like to experience on a platform. User stories are then created from these needs. These user stories are extemely helpful because they give you exact directions as to what needs to be accomplished. This also makes it very easy to pass on to other teams to complete.

I approach developing programs as follows:
- I start by looking at the user stories
- Then I will put myself in the shoes of the user and see what the story should look like as a finished product
- Lastly, I will start developing and if any questions/obstacles arise, I will send an email to the PO for clarity

To me, a good team member in software development is an openly communicative team member. I believe that constant, open communication is necessary for efficient, quality product development.
